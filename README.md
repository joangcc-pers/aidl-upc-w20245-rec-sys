## Project Description

This project aims to explore and apply advanced concepts of artificial intelligence and deep learning. Through this repository, the following work is documented:

- Implementation of Deep Learning algorithms.
- Data analysis and processing.
- Training and evaluation of predictive models.

## Contents

The repository is organized as follows:
- **tentative_name**: Work in progress...

## Workflow

- Branch from develop when testing a new feature.
- After new feature has been added, merge to develop, NOT to main.
- Test everything in develop in the cloud, and when it is working, merge to main.
- Do **NOT** merge to main directly, so that we are sure that before marging to main, the test works in develop first.

## Requirements
